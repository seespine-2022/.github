## Architecture

[Describe here how this repo is related to other repos]

## Getting Started

To set up the project, ensure you have the required dependencies installed and follow the instructions provided in the documentation. Familiarize yourself with the project structure, coding standards, and security guidelines to ensure you adhere to our compliance requirements while working on the project.

## Code Review Guidelines

To ensure code quality and compliance, we follow a strict code review process:

1. **Review every pull request**: Every pull request must be reviewed and approved by at least one other developer with relevant expertise.
2. **Check for compliance**: Reviewers must ensure the changes comply with HIPAA, PIPEDA, GDPR, SOC2, and ISO27001 requirements.
3. **Assess security impact**: Reviewers must analyze the security impact of changes and ensure that they don't introduce new vulnerabilities or weaken existing security measures.
4. **Follow coding standards**: Reviewers must ensure that the submitted code follows established coding standards and best practices.
5. **Verify test coverage**: Confirm that the changes are accompanied by appropriate test cases and that existing tests still pass.
6. **Examine documentation**: Reviewers must ensure that the changes are properly documented, following the established documentation standards.
7. **Validate performance and scalability**: Reviewers should assess the performance and scalability impact of the changes, ensuring they don't negatively affect the application.
8. **Monitor for conflicts of interest**: Developers should not review or approve their own code. The review process must remain unbiased.
9. **Discuss and resolve issues**: Reviewers and contributors should engage in constructive discussions to resolve any issues or disagreements that arise during the review process.
10. **Keep a record of reviews**: Maintain a log of code reviews, approvals, and any issues raised for auditing and tracking purposes.

By adhering to these guidelines, we maintain a high standard of code quality and ensure compliance with relevant regulations.

## Documentation Standards

Maintaining clear and concise documentation is crucial for the project. To ensure compliance and consistency, we follow these documentation standards:

1. **Comprehensive coverage**: All features, functions, and components of the application should be thoroughly documented, including any dependencies and configurations, through seperate documents or in PRs.
2. **Regulatory requirements**: Documentation must address the relevant compliance requirements, such as HIPAA, PIPEDA, GDPR, SOC2, and ISO27001.
3. **Clear and concise**: Use clear and concise language, avoiding jargon and ensuring that documentation is easily understandable by all team members.
4. **Structured and organized**: Organize documentation into logical sections, using headings and subheadings to make it easy to navigate and find information.
5. **Version control**: Maintain version control for all documentation, ensuring that the most up-to-date information is available to all team members. This is done automatically if it stored in this repository.
6. **Code comments**: Use comments in the code to explain complex or critical sections, ensuring that other developers can easily understand and maintain the code.
7. **Security guidelines**: Include security guidelines and best practices in documentation, ensuring that team members are aware of the necessary precautions to maintain a secure application.
8. **Continuous updates**: Update documentation regularly, ensuring that it stays current with any changes or updates to the application.
9. **Review and approval**: All documentation must be reviewed and approved by relevant team members, ensuring that it meets established standards and compliance requirements.

By adhering to these standards, we ensure that our documentation is clear, accurate, and compliant with relevant regulations.

## Branching Strategy

We use GitHub Flow as our branching strategy to streamline development and ensure a consistent workflow. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Create a feature branch**: For each new feature or bug fix, create a new branch from the `main` branch.
2. **Commit changes**: Commit your changes to the feature branch, following the established coding standards and best practices.
3. **Push the branch**: Push the feature branch to the remote repository.
4. **Open a pull request**: Create a pull request for the feature branch, requesting a review from relevant team members.
5. **Deploy to staging**: Automatically deploy the changes to a separate staging environment for further testing and validation.
6. **Address feedback**: Address any feedback from the code review process, making changes as needed.
7. **Merge into `main`**: Once the pull request is approved, merge the feature branch into the `main` branch.
8. **Push to production**: After merging into main we automatically deploy to the production environment.

By following this branching strategy, we maintain a clean and efficient development process while ensuring compliance with relevant regulations.

## Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

Our CI/CD pipeline is designed to automate the testing, building, and deployment processes, ensuring a consistent and efficient workflow. The key components of our pipeline are:

1. **Automated testing**: Run a suite of unit, integration, and behavioral tests on every commit and pull request to ensure code quality and functionality.
2. **Security scanning**: Conduct automated security scans to identify potential vulnerabilities and verify that the application remains secure.
3. **Build and package**: Automatically build and package the application for deployment.
4. **Deploy to staging**: Deploy the application to a separate staging environment for further testing and validation.
5. **Manual approval**: Require manual approval from relevant team members before pushing changes to the production environment.
6. **Deploy to production**: Once approved, deploy the changes to the production environment.

By implementing a robust CI/CD pipeline, we ensure a smooth and efficient development process, while maintaining compliance with relevant regulations.

## Change Request Process

To ensure smooth and efficient management of changes, we have implemented a change request process. This process aims to provide a clear and standardized approach to proposing, reviewing, and implementing changes while maintaining security and compliance with relevant regulations.

1. **Submit a change request**: Any team member can propose a change by creating a new GitHub Issue in the repository. The issue must include a clear description of the proposed change, its rationale, and potential impacts on security and compliance.
2. **Notify affected parties**: Upon submission of a change request, all affected parties will be notified through GitHub's built-in notification system, including developers, product owners, and the Security Team.
3. **User responsibilities**: Users proposing a change must provide sufficient information in the issue to support their request and collaborate with the Security Team during the review and implementation process.
4. **Security Team responsibilities**: The Security Team is responsible for assessing the security and compliance implications of the proposed change, providing feedback via comments on the GitHub Issue, and approving or rejecting the change request. They also have the authority to request additional information, modifications, or mitigations to ensure the change maintains the required security and compliance standards.
5. **Communication**: Once a decision has been made, the Security Team will update the issue with the outcome and communicate the decision to all affected parties, along with any necessary next steps or revisions.
6. **Implementation**: If the change request is approved, the team member who proposed the change will be responsible for implementing it, following the existing development processes and guidelines.
